Hereâ€™s a **professional README** you can use for your Virtual Biomedical Lab React project:

---

# ðŸ§ª Virtual Biomedical Lab Platform

An **interactive, gamified virtual lab** built with **React** for Biomedical Engineering students to simulate core laboratory experiments, track progress, and earn badges â€” without requiring physical lab access.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

### ðŸ”¹ **Dashboard**

* Displays **student profile**, badges earned, and total score.
* Tracks **progress** across all available experiments.
* Interactive grid view of available experiments.

### ðŸ”¹ **Available Experiments**

1. **Osmotic Solutions Lab**

   * Simulate isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic effects on onion cells & RBCs.
   * Step-by-step guided protocol with microscope view.
   * Realistic cell morphology changes and solution identification quiz.

2. **Bradford Protein Assay**

   * Quantify protein concentration using BSA standards & Bradford reagent.
   * Interactive pipetting, reagent addition, incubation, and microplate reading.
   * Automatic **standard curve** generation & unknown concentration calculation.

3. **PCR Amplification Simulation**

   * Design primers with GC-content checks.
   * Prepare PCR master mix with precise reagent volumes.
   * Simulate thermal cycling & gel electrophoresis.
   * Analyze amplified DNA fragments.

4. **Gram Staining Protocol** *(Planned)*

   * Differentiation of Gram-positive & Gram-negative bacteria.
   * Interactive staining sequence and microscope visualization.

5. **Cytoskeleton & Nucleus Staining** *(Planned)*

   * Actin filament & nuclear staining using phalloidin & DAPI.
   * Fluorescence microscopy simulation.

### ðŸ”¹ **Gamification**

* Earn **badges** for each completed experiment.
* Grade calculation based on **accuracy & mistakes**.
* Real-time progress tracking and scoring.
